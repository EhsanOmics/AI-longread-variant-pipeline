🧬 Long-Read Variant Detection Pipeline

A reproducible and scalable pipeline for detecting genomic variants from long-read sequencing data using Snakemake and machine learning filtering. This workflow integrates alignment, SNP/SV calling, annotation, and filtering — ideal for showcasing reproducibility, modular design, and scientific branding.

🚀 Features

- Alignment (Minimap2)  
- SNP calling (Clair3)  
- Structural variant detection (Sniffles)  
- Annotation (Ensembl VEP)  
- Filtering (bcftools + ML classifier)  
- Logging and summary reports

🧪 How to Run

Use the command snakemake --cores 8 to execute the full pipeline. It will generate filtered variants and annotated reports. Compatible with Linux and cloud platforms.

📊 Output Files

All results are saved in results/:  
- merged.vcf – Combined SNPs and SVs  
- filtered.vcf – Final filtered variants  
- annotation.vcf – VEP-annotated variants  
- pipeline.log – Execution log  
- summary_plots/ – PNG visualizations

---

📌 Sample Configuration

Defined in config.yaml:  
- Sample name(s)  
- Reference genome path  
- VEP cache location  
- Thread count  
- ML model path

Example:
`yaml
samples:
  - sample1
reference: "data/reference/genome.fa"
vepcache: "data/reference/vepcache/"
mlmodel: "models/trainedclassifier.pkl"
threads: 8
